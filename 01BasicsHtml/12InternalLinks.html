        Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders expect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different purposes. Thus, some static do’s and don’ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features: maintainability, dependability, and usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be written.

    <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

    <p>
        This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and architecture. An important question is how development is structured. What is the specific purpose of the software? The problem that the code is meant to solve must be clear to the developer. What is the design of the individual components? Such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a good code is being written.

    <p>
        Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software design and architecture. Either a code is so simple that there are obviously no errors, or a code is so complex that there are no obvious errors. Software design is also of importance to clients, who can decide if their needs are being adequately addressed. If there are some things that architecture cannot take care of, then those are handled in the software design phase. A detailed design is a good guide for coding.

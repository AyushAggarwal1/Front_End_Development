        HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it's the "code" behind every webpage - even this one. If you're just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML, without styling, can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames - but it is handy as it helps you structure the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

        However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes to full-fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process - but if you want to be in full control of your web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.

    <p> Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.

        Let's look at two types of tags:

        <ol>
            <li>&lt tag-example-1 &gt I need a closing tag &lt tag-example-1 &gt</li>
            <li>&lt tag-example-2 &gt I didn't need a closing tag</li>
        </ol>

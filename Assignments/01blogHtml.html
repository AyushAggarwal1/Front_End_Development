        HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it's the "code" behind every webpage - even this one. If you're just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML, without styling, can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames - but it is handy as it helps you structure the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.
